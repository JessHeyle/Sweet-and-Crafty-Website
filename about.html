				Sweet and Crafty Cork began with orders for friends and family, and expanded through our Facebook page which was set up at the beginning of 2015.<br><br> 
				Word soon spread and it has been a very busy few months.<br><br> We began with just regular Sweet Cones and have grown hugely since, expanding to include Mini Cones, Bars, Lollipops, Chocolate Coins, 
				Love Heart Sweets, Bubbles and Drinks to name a few.<br><br> With more expansions on the horizon, we anticipate a busy year ahead.<br><br>
				
				We pride ourselves on the personalized touch, with all of our items being designed by us and created by us. We continue to provide excellent 
				quality and service and always aim to improve.

					<h3>Our Contributions</h3>
			
				<p>
				We also like to contribute to charity and community events. We provided sweet cones for the Frozen Ball which was hosted by Lets Party Cork in aid of the 
				Childrens Ward. We also raised over &#8364;500 the Yes Equality Cork Campaign by selling 'Lollipops for Love', as pictured below, with 100% of the profit going to the campaign.
